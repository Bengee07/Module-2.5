### Lesson Overview

Developments in cloud technology make it possible to replicate almost any data center activity on hosted infrastructure. So, what is so special about cloud databases? And why should you consider moving to a Database as a Service model?

### What is a Database-as-a-service?

Database-as-a-service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing service. As a hosted/managed service, users don’t have to worry about setting up hardware or installing software. Everything related to managing the database is handled by the service provider.


Database hosting options are available for all database types, including NoSQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. MongoDB Atlas is one example of a NoSQL DBaaS service that is easily scalable.


The DBaaS subscription includes everything required to operate a database in the cloud – including database provisioning, licenses, support, and maintenance. Developers can make use of cloud hosted APIs to build out new applications, accessing and manipulating data programmatically. Because of this, DBaaS shares many similarities with other SaaS subscription-based cloud offerings.


As a managed service, there is no additional overhead; you can get right to work extracting value from your data store.


### How Does DBaaS Work?

Once the data has been uploaded, the DBaaS database engine itself operates in almost exactly the same way as an on-premises installation. In fact, the very same core is installed in the hosted data center. For developers, DBAs, and data engineers, the experience is almost indistinguishable from working with a local database.


The major difference is the physical infrastructure on which a cloud database runs. In a public Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environment like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and MongoDB Atlas, the database engine (and data) is run on a shared hardware platform. This adds the compute power, resource elasticity, and scalability needed to support your growing data stores and processing needs.


### How is Database-as-a-service Different from Database Management?


Cloud database management is often much simpler than traditional on-premises equivalents. The database administration tools themselves are almost identical, allowing you to provision databases quickly and easily on the hosted infrastructure.


The major difference between DBaaS and local deployments is the amount of back-end administration required. Cloud computing principles allow you to offload time-consuming infrastructure administration to the service provider; they are responsible for ensuring the physical and application layers are operational and optimized.


Whether you are an individual developer or operate a team of data engineers and developers, outsourcing infrastructure administration frees you to focus on the data itself, reclaiming time and resources that would normally have been spent on low-level maintenance tasks.
